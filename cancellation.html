<p>Any cancellations with less than 24 hours of notice are subject to a cancelation fee amounting to the cost of the scheduled service. Clients who miss their appointments without giving any prior notification will be charged 50% of  appointment for the scheduled service. . No-shows will be charged in full for the scheduled service.</p>
<p>We recognize the time of our clients and staff is valuable and have implemented this policy for this reason. When you miss an appointment with us, we not only lose your business, but also the potential business of other clients who could have scheduled an appointment for the same time. </p>
